# Who am I ?
My name's Seven Petals. I'm a computer science / cybersecurity enthusiast, and my skills are broadening by the day when it comes to security.

# How can I be reached ?
You can either reach me through e-mail at the address you can see on my profile. You can also see my GPG key to verify my identity if you encounter me in the wild, or if you want to reach me.
I may add other means to reach me in the future, but that's no guarantee.

Remember gold as my favorite color
Currently in love with flowers
However I also love coding
Likely to crack dark jokes
